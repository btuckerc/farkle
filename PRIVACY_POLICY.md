# Privacy Policy — Farkle Scorer

**Effective date:** 2025-12-23  
**App name:** Farkle Scorer  
**Developer/Contact:** Tucker Craig (`btuckerc.dev@gmail.com`)

## Summary
Farkle Scorer is a scorekeeping utility for the Farkle dice game. **We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data.** The app is designed to work offline.

## Data We Collect
**None.**  
Farkle Scorer does not collect data about you and does not send any information to our servers (we do not operate any servers for the app).

## Data Stored on Your Device
The app stores limited information **locally on your device** using Apple’s standard on-device storage (e.g., `UserDefaults`) to provide core functionality and preferences, such as:
- Player names and roster (for convenience)
- Current game state and scores (so you can resume)
- Scoring customization / house rules
- App preferences (theme, haptics, UI options)

This data stays on your device. If you use Apple device backup features (for example, iCloud Backup), your device backup may include this locally stored data. Apple manages backups under your Apple ID and device settings.

## Data Retention and Deletion
Because Farkle Scorer does not collect data, we do not retain any personal data on servers.

To delete locally stored app data, you can:
- Delete the app from your device, or
- Use iOS storage controls to remove the app and its data.

## Tracking
Farkle Scorer **does not track you** across apps or websites and does not use the iOS App Tracking Transparency framework.

## Third-Party Services
Farkle Scorer **does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDKs**.

## Permissions
Farkle Scorer may request access to the **Local Network** to support nearby multiplayer gameplay. This is optional for single-device scorekeeping.

If you enable multiplayer, the app uses local network discovery to find and connect to nearby devices. Multiplayer communication occurs directly between devices on your local network (we do not receive this data).

## Children’s Privacy
Farkle Scorer does not knowingly collect personal information from children (or anyone). Because the app does not collect data, there is nothing for us to share or monetize.

## Changes to This Policy
If we change this privacy policy, we will update the **Effective date** above and publish the updated policy at the same location.

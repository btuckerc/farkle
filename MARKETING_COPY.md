## Full description

```
Farkle Scorer is a fast, flexible scorekeeper for the classic dice game. Track turns, bank points, and keep everyone’s totals clear—whether you share one device or connect nearby devices for multiplayer.

WHY YOU’LL LIKE IT
• Score fast — tap dice to calculate points and keep turns moving
• Manual mode — enter scores when you’re rolling physical dice
• Clear scoreboard — always know who’s leading and how close they are
• Undo friendly — fix accidental taps without slowing the game down
• House rules — customize scoring and key rule options for your table
• Nearby multiplayer — connect nearby devices (optional) for multi-device play
• Offline-first — no internet required
• No ads, no accounts — just scorekeeping

HOW IT WORKS
1. Add players and choose your winning score and rule options.
2. Score a turn by selecting dice (or use Manual Mode for physical dice).
3. Bank points, handle Farkles, and keep playing.
4. View the scoreboard anytime and crown the winner.

PRIVACY
Farkle Scorer collects no personal data. Game data and preferences stay on your device.

NEARBY MULTIPLAYER
If you enable multiplayer, the app uses your local network to find and connect nearby devices. This is optional and not used for tracking.
